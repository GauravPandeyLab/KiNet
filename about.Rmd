## Hello Shiny!
### Introduction 

The kinase-substrate interaction network collects information about kinase-substrate interactions from publicly available data sources.

### Workflows 

##### Exploring the network
The "Explore the network" tab shows the kinase-substrate interactions that involve a specific protein as either kinase or substrate. To explore the network, select a new protein or double-click on the node for an existing protein.

##### Visualize pathways
The "Visualize pathways" tab shows kinases and substrates from selected pathways in KEGG database.

##### Visualize custom gene sets
On the "Visualize custom gene sets" tab, you can examine any chosen subset of genes in the network.

### Sources
Our database draws kinase-substrate interactions from PhosphoSitePlus, EPSD and iPTMNet databases. Gene-names and protein names are standardized against the UniProt Reference Human Proteome (9606).
